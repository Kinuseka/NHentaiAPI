## Note:
> Bypassing cloudflare requires a modified selenium which does not support headless mode. If you are not on a 
desktop environment, you are better off setting `cf_bypass` to `false` in config.json.

> Mirror server is enabled by default incase the official site is not available, if you prefer
to disable this. Please set "mirror_available" to `false` in config.json

> The Mirror server is slightly outdated compared to the official site. Some titles might not be available especially to newer release like 40000+.
though they are being continually updated as time goes.
